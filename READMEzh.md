## Is ending world hunger possible?
Personally, we dont think so, Why?


On _oct 31st, 2021. at around 2:50 PM_, Elon replied to a tweet Saying:
_"If WFP can describe on this Twitter thread exactly
 how $6B will solve world hunger, I will sell Tesla stock right now and do it."_

But then..
 Elon Musk donated around **$5.74** billion to charity in November
 just weeks after tweeting that if the UN World Food Program showed
 him how $6 billion would solve world hunger, he would “sell Tesla stock right now and do it.”

[here is a link to that tweet](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1454808104256737289?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1454808104256737289%7Ctwgr%5Edc9fe6755ceec10aaa87222d323709cd1ea3f398%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.weforum.org%2Fagenda%2F2021%2F11%2Felon-musk-un-world-hunger-famine%2F)
